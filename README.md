# Module 5 Challenge

In this activity, you will be tasked with calculating a number of summary statistics using California housing data.

## Ramicane for Treatment

Ramicane for Treatment
Ramicane was slightly more effective in reducing tumor size than Capomulin. The median tumor size of the mice on Ramicane was about 40.21, with a variance of 23.48. If you compare it to Capomulin, the median tumor size was 41.55, with a variance of 24.94. The two medications outperform the remaining 8 medications, which could be because they were used the least amount in this study. 

## Additional Information Needed:
Additional Information Needed:
The frequency of the medication and amounts should also be included in the data. It is unclear if the Ramicane or Capomulin were given in equal amounts compared to the other medication. The least amount of drugs given would reduce complications and the cost of the treatment.
